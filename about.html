        <h3>History: Catching the First Wave</h3>
        <p>The Surf Rockers were founded in <strong>Dana Point, California</strong>, by six friends with a shared love for surf culture and rock & roll.

From playing backyard beach parties to headlining major venues, The Surf Rockers have built a reputation for delivering electrifying performances that capture the spirit of California’s golden coast.</p>
